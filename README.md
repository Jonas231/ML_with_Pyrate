# Machine Learning with Pyrate ray tracing

A small project using the ray tracing tool Pyrate (https://github.com/teaghan/ML_with_Pyrate) to create an optical system and trace the distortion of images. An auto-encoder is then used to learn the inverse ray-tracing and correct the deformed images. See the ML_with_Pyrate_poster.pdf poster for an overview of the project and the Machine_Learning_with_Pyrate.ipynb notebook for the code.
